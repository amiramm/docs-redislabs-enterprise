<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Redis Enterprise Pack for PCF v5.0.0 Beta is not intended for production use.
   For production use, Redis Labs recommends Redis Enterprise Pack for PCF v0.0.81.</p>

Redis Enterprise (Redis<sup>e</sup>) Pack clusters are enterprise grade, highly available and scalable Redis clusters with substantially lower operational overhead than any other Redis deployment method.

Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack extends open source Redis and delivers tangible benefits of stable high performance, zero-downtime linear scaling and hassle-free true high availability, with significant operational savings.

This documentation describes Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).
Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack for PCF exposes its service plans on the Marketplace.
Developers can provision highly available and scalable Redis databases by creating instances of the service plans using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI).

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack is an enterprise-grade cluster that acts as a container for managing and running multiple Redis databases in a highly available and scalable manner.

By default, a three-node Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack cluster is deployed for you.

For specific information about Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack, and to get started, see the [Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack documentation](https://redislabs.com/redis-enterprise-documentation/overview/).
