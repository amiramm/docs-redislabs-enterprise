This topic describes how to install and configure Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

##<a id='install'></a> Install Redis Enterprise Pack for PCF

1. Download the product file from Pivotal Network.

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

1. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to the version number of Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack for PCF.
This adds the tile to your staging area.


1. Click **Save**.

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to install Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack for PCF tile.


## <a id='install-step2'></a>Configure and Deploy Redis Enterprise Pack for PCF

1. Click the newly imported tile.<br /> ![Imported tile](./images/pcf_pre-install_tile.png)

1. Navigate to the **Assign AZs and Network** section on the right navigation bar. Ensure you have a network selected for the cluster to use.

1. Navigate to the **Redis Enterprise Pack** section on the right navigation bar. Enter the following details:

1. From the **Settings** tab, click **Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack** and complete the following fields:
    
* **Cluster Name**: Provide a sub-domain for the cluster name. The Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack cluster name is a sub-domain under the system domain, which is found under the Pivotal Elastic Runtime in Ops Manager. 

    For example, set the cluster name as `CLUSTERNAME.redislabs.com` if your system domain is `redislabs.com`. The cluster name specified represents part of the connection string for Redis applications when connecting to Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack databases using DNS-based connections.
    
* **Admin Email**: Provide an email that has full administrative privileges to the new Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack cluster.
    
* **Admin account password**: Provide the password for the administrative account.

    For production clusters, you can also provide a set of static IPs addresses to use for cluster nodes and enabled Multiple Availability Zone (Rack) awareness.

    <p class="note"><strong>Important</strong>: Ensure the capacity used for Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack cluster nodes meet the minimum hardware specification requirements for Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack.
    For more information, see <a href="https://redislabs.com/redis-enterprise-documentation/installing-and-upgrading/hardware-software-requirements/"> the minimum hardware specifications</a> in the Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack documentation.</p>

1. Click **Save**.

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to deploy Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack for PCF tile.

## <a id='install-step4'></a>Create a New Database on the Redis Enterprise Pack Cluster

1. Connect to the Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack Admin Console by putting the **Cluster Name** you previously specified in the URL: `https://rpadmin.CLUSTER-NAME`

1. Log in using the Administrator email account and password you specified in the tile configuration above.

1. Navigate to the **databases** tab and create a new database by selecting **redis db**.

1. Click **Activate** to create your database.

You now have a Redis database on Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack.

## <a id='install-step5'></a>Connect to Redis Database Using redis-cli

`redis-cli` is a simple command-line tool for interacting with Redis database.

To connect to Redis Database do the following:

1. Connect to one of the IP addresses of the nodes through SSH and find `redis-cli` under `/opt/redislabs/bin/redis-cli`.

1. Change to the `/opt/redislabs/bin` directory and run `redis-cli` to connect to port 12000, and to the database-endpoint that is reported in the database properties after you created the database.

    ```
    # sudo /opt/redislabs/bin/redis-cli -p 12000 -h database-endpoint
    ```

1. To store and retrieve a key in database1, do the following:

    ```
    127.0.0.1:16653> set key1 123
    OK
    127.0.0.1:16653> get key1
    "123"
    ```
